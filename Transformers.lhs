\noindent
In this tutorial, we describe how to use monad transformers in order
to incrementally add functionality to Haskell programs.  It is not a
paper about \emph{implementing} transformers, but about \emph{using}
them to write elegant, clean and powerful programs in Haskell.
Starting from an evaluation function for simple expressions, we
convert it to monadic style and incrementally add error handling,
environment passing, state, logging and input/output by composing
monad transformers.

\section{Introduction}

This paper gives a step-by-step introduction to monad transformers in
Haskell.

Monads are a remarkably elegant way for structuring programs in a
flexible and extensible way.  They are especially interesting in a
lazy functional language like Haskell, because they allow the
integration of side-effects into otherwise purely functional programs.
Furthermore, by structuring a program with monads, it is possible to
hide much of the necessary book-keeping and plumbing necessary for
many algorithms in a handful of definitions specific for the monad in
use, removing the clutter from the main algorithm.

Monad transformers offer an additional benefit to monadic programming:
by providing a library of different monads and types and functions for
combining these monads, it is possible to create custom monads simply
by composing the necessary monad transformers.  For example, if you
need a monad with state and error handling, just take the |StateT| and
|ErrorT| monad transformers and combine them.  The goal of this paper
is to give a gentle introduction to the use of monad transformers by
starting with a simple function and extending it step by step with
various monadic operations in order to extend its functionality.  This
paper is \emph{not} about the theory underlying the monad transformer
concept, and not about their implementation (except for what is
necessary for successfully using them).

The reader is expected to be familiar with functional and basic
monadic programming, such as the use of the |Monad| class and |do|
notation in Haskell.  Everything else will be explained on the fly.

The Haskell programs in this paper use language features which are not
in the current Haskell'98 standard, since they use the non-standard
library modules |Control.Monad.Error| etc.  Both the hierarchical
module names of these modules and some of their implementation details
are beyond Haskell'98.  Nevertheless, these extensions are well
supported in current versions of the Glasgow Haskell compiler (GHC)
\cite{GHC2006GHCHomepage} and the Hugs Haskell interpreter
\cite{Hugs2006HugsHomepage}.  The programs have been tested using
versions 6.4.2 and 6.5 (pre-release) of GHC and version 20050308 of
Hugs\footnote{You need to pass the \texttt{-98} option to Hugs in
order to allow the required Haskell extensions.}.

The monad transformer modules are inspired by a paper by Mark P. Jones
\cite{Jones1995FunctionalProgramming}, which gives a very readable
introduction to monadic programming, but is less practical than this
paper.

This document has been converted from a literate Haskell script using
Andres L{\"o}h's \texttt{lhs2TeX}\footnote{\small\tt
http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/\~{}loeh/} preprocessor.  The script is
executable by both GHC and Hugs.  The literate Haskell source file
\texttt{Transformers.lhs} is available from my
homepage\footnote{\small\tt \url{http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/~magr/pub/Transformers.lhs}}.

It is probably best to read this paper near a computer so that you can
look up the types and descriptions of the various functions used from
the monad transformer library or the Haskell standard library.  The
best setup is a printed copy of this paper, a web browser showing the
online library documentation and a running incarnation of ghci or hugs
with a loaded |Transformers| module (to be introduced below) for
checking out types interactively using the \texttt{:type} (or
\texttt{:t}) command.

\subsection{Example Program}
\label{sec:example-program}

As a running example, an interpreter for a simple programming language
will be used throughout the paper.  All the code will be located in a module called |Transformers|, which has the following header:

> module Transformers where
> 
> import Control.Monad.Identity
> import Control.Monad.Error
> import Control.Monad.Reader
> import Control.Monad.State
> import Control.Monad.Writer
> 
> import Data.Maybe
> import qualified Data.Map as Map
> 

Several of the imported modules beginning with |Control.Monad| are
only needed when you use the monad transformers defined there.  The
|Data.Maybe| module defines useful functions for dealing with optional
values of type |Maybe a|, and the module |Data.Map| defines finite
maps.  These will be used to define environments (variable-value
mappings) in our little interpreter.

The following data types for modelling programs in that language will
be used:

> type Name   =  String                -- variable names
> 
> data Exp    =  Lit Integer           -- expressions
>             |  Var Name
>             |  Plus Exp Exp
>             |  Abs Name Exp
>             |  App Exp Exp
>             deriving (Show)
> 
> data Value  =  IntVal Integer        -- values
>             |  FunVal Env Name Exp
>             deriving (Show)
> 
> type Env    =  Map.Map Name Value    -- mapping from names to values

The |Name| type is simply a shorthand for the standard |String| type.
It is used to make clear when we are talking about variable names and
not about general strings.  The |Exp| data type has variants for
literal integers (constants), variables, addition, $\lambda$
expressions (abstractions) and function application.  The programs
which are to be evaluated will be made up of the |Exp| data type,
whereas the results are from the |Value| type.  Values are either
integers or functions (closures).  The |Env| component of a |FunVal|
is the environment in which the corresponding $\lambda$-abstraction was
evaluated.

Since the example for using monad transformers will be an interpreter
for the little language defined above, we start by defining an
evaluation function.  This function is not monadic and will serve as a
kind of ``reference implementation''.  The definition of the
interpreter function, called |eval0|, is straightforward.

> eval0                   ::  Env -> Exp -> Value
> eval0 env (Lit i)       =   IntVal i
> eval0 env (Var n)       =   fromJust (Map.lookup n env)
> eval0 env (Plus e1 e2)  =   let  IntVal i1  = eval0 env e1
>                                  IntVal i2  = eval0 env e2
>                             in IntVal (i1 + i2)
> eval0 env (Abs n e)     =   FunVal env n e
> eval0 env (App e1 e2)   =   let  val1  = eval0 env e1
>                                  val2  = eval0 env e2
>                             in case val1 of
>                                  FunVal env' n body -> eval0 (Map.insert n val2 env') body

Integer literals simply evaluate to themselves (packaged up in the
|Value| data type), variables evaluate to the values to which they are
bound in the environment.  The use of the
|fromJust|\footnote{|fromJust| has the type |Maybe alpha -> alpha|}
function is necessary because the |Map.lookup| function returns a
|Maybe| value.  Note that the use of this function introduces an error
condition: when a variable is used which is not bound anywhere using a
$\lambda$ expression, the program will halt with an error
message. Addition is implemented by simply evaluating both operands
and returning their sum. Whenever one of the addition operands
evaluates to a non-number, the pattern matching in the |let|
expression will fail, also terminating the program with an error
message.  Abstractions simply evaluate to functional values, which
capture the environment in which they are evaluated.  Function
application proceeds similar to addition, by first evaluating the
function and the argument.  The first expression must evaluate to a
functional value, whose body is then evaluated in the captured
environment, extended with the binding of the function parameter to
the argument value.  The |case| expression used here to deconstruct
the functional value introduces another error possibility.  In later
sections of this text, we will handle these error cases using an error
monad, which gives us more control over their handling.

The definition of |eval0| could be shortened a little bit, for
example, the |let| expression in the |App| case seems superfluous.
Nevertheless, the definition given here will make it easier to relate
it to the monadic versions defined below.

The following example expression, $$12+((\lambda x \to x) (4 + 2))$$
can be used to test this interpreter and all of the others we will
define shortly.

> exampleExp = Lit 12 `Plus` (App (Abs "x" (Var "x")) (Lit 4 `Plus` Lit 2))

For example, entering

\begin{verbatim}
    eval0 Map.empty exampleExp
\end{verbatim}
in \texttt{ghci} will give the answer
\begin{verbatim}
    IntVal 18
\end{verbatim}

\section{Monad Transformers}

The goal of using monad transformers is to have control over aspects
of computations, such as state, errors, environments etc.  It is a bit
tedious to reformulate an already written program in monadic style,
but once that is done, it is relatively easy to add, remove or change
the monads involved.

In this section, we will first rewrite the example program from
Section~\ref{sec:example-program} in monadic style and then extend the
data types and function definitions with various monad transformer
types and functions step by step.

\subsection{Converting to Monadic Style}

In order to use monad transformers, it is necessary to express
functions in monadic style.  That means that the programmer needs to
impose sequencing on all monadic operations using |do| notation, and
to use the |return| function in order to specify the result of a
function.

First, we define a monad in which the evaluator will be defined.  The
following type synonym defines |Eval1 alpha| as a synonym for the type
|Identity alpha|.  |Identity| is a monad imported from
|Control.Monad.Identity|, which is perhaps the simplest monad
imaginable: it defines the standard |return| and |>>=| operations for
constructing operations in the monad, and additionally a function
|runIdentity| to execute such operations.  Other than that, the
identity monad has no effect.  In some sense, we will use this monad
as a ``base case'', around which other monad transformers can be
wrapped.  For readability, we also define a function |runEval1|, which
simply calls |runIdentity|.

> type Eval1 alpha  =   Identity alpha
> 
> runEval1          ::  Eval1 alpha -> alpha
> runEval1 ev       =   runIdentity ev

Based on the |Eval1| monad, we now rewrite the |eval0| function as
|eval1|:

> eval1                   ::  Env -> Exp -> Eval1 Value
> eval1 env (Lit i)       =   return $ IntVal i
> eval1 env (Var n)       =   Map.lookup n env
> eval1 env (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  IntVal i1  <- eval1 env e1
>                                 IntVal i2  <- eval1 env e2
>                                 return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
> eval1 env (Abs n e)     =   return $ FunVal env n e
> eval1 env (App e1 e2)   =   do  val1  <- eval1 env e1
>                                 val2  <- eval1 env e2
>                                 case val1 of
>                                   FunVal env' n body ->
>                                       eval1 (Map.insert n val2 env') body

The first thing to note is that the cases for |Lit| and |Abs| use the
|return| function for specifying their result.\footnote{The |($)|
operator is function application with low precedence and mainly used
to avoid parentheses.}  The next is that the |Var| case does not need
a |fromJust| call anymore: The reason is that |Map.lookup| is defined
to work within any monad by simply calling the monad's |fail| function
-- this fits nicely with our monadic formulation here.  (The |fail|
function of the |Maybe| monad returns |Nothing|, whereas the |fail|
function in the |Identity| monad throws an exception, which will lead
to different error messages.)

The |Plus| and |App| cases now evaluate their subexpressions using
|do|-notation, binding their results to variables.  In the |Plus|
case, the result is returned using |return|, whereas in th |App| case,
the function value is further discriminated like in the |eval0|
function above.

In order to test this interpreter, we have to evaluate the monadic
action obtained by applying |eval1| to our example expression
|exampleExp|.  This is done by calling |runEval1| defined earlier:

\begin{verbatim}
    runEval1 (eval1 Map.empty exampleExp)
\end{verbatim}
gives
\begin{verbatim}
    IntVal 18
\end{verbatim}

To recapitulate: conversion to monadic form consists mainly of
returning function results using the |return| function, and sequencing
of monadic actions using |do| notation or the |>>=| or |>>| (monadic
bind) functions.

\paragraph{Note:}
The type of |eval1| could be generalized to 
$$
|eval1 :: Monad m => Env -> Exp -> m Value|, 
$$
because we do not use any monadic operations other than |return| and
|>>=| (hidden in the |do| notation).  This allows the use of |eval1|
in any monadic context, so that instead of
\begin{verbatim}
    runEval1 (eval1 Map.empty exampleExp)
\end{verbatim}
we could write
\begin{verbatim}
    eval1 Map.empty exampleExp
\end{verbatim}
%

at the \texttt{ghci} prompt.  This would run the expression in the
|IO| monad, because internally the interpreter uses the |print|
function, which lives in just this monad.\footnote{This only works in
recent versions of GHC and unfortunately not in Hugs.}  In some
contexts, this is a nice feature, but in general you will be using
some operations specific to a particular monad, and this forces your
operation to stay within that special monad.

\subsection{Adding Error Handling}

We have already seen that our evaluation function is partial, that
means it will terminate with an error message for some inputs, for
example for expressions with unbound variables or type errors.

Using monad transformers, we simply go to our local monad transformer
library and take the |ErrorT| monad transformer, using it to extend
the basic |Eval1| monad to |Eval2|.

> type Eval2 alpha = ErrorT String Identity alpha

The |String| type argument to |ErrorT| is the type of exceptions, that
is the values which are used to indicate error conditions.  We use
|String| here to keep things simple, in a real implementation we might
want to include source code locations (in a compiler) or time stamps
(in some kind of web application).

The function for running a computation in the |Eval2| monad changes in
two ways.  First, the result of evaluation is now of type |Either
String alpha|, where the result |Left s| indicates that an error has
occurred with error message |s|, or |Right r|, which stands for
successful evaluation with result~|r|.  Second, we need to call the
function |runErrorT| on the given computation to yield an |Identity|
computation, which can in turn be evaluated using |runIdentity|.

> runEval2     :: Eval2 alpha -> Either String alpha
> runEval2 ev  = runIdentity (runErrorT ev)

We can now simply change the type of our |eval1| function, giving the
following version, called |eval2a|.

> eval2a                   ::  Env -> Exp -> Eval2 Value
> eval2a env (Lit i)       =   return $ IntVal i
> eval2a env (Var n)       =   Map.lookup n env
> eval2a env (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  IntVal i1  <- eval2a env e1
>                                  IntVal i2  <- eval2a env e2
>                                  return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
> eval2a env (Abs n e)     =   return $ FunVal env n e
> eval2a env (App e1 e2)   =   do  val1  <- eval2a env e1
>                                  val2  <- eval2a env e2
>                                  case val1 of
>                                     FunVal env' n body ->
>                                        eval2a (Map.insert n val2 env') body

This version can be run using the |runEval2| function defined above.
When we apply this function to our example expression, the result only
varies in that it is wrapped in a |Right| constructor:
\begin{spec}
runEval2 (eval2a Map.empty exampleExp) => Right (IntVal 18)
\end{spec}

But unfortunately, when given an invalid expression, the error
reporting of the |ErrorT| transformer is not used.  We have to modify
our definition in order to give useful error messages:

> eval2b                   ::  Env -> Exp -> Eval2 Value
> eval2b env (Lit i)       =   return $ IntVal i
> eval2b env (Var n)       =   Map.lookup n env
> eval2b env (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  e1'  <- eval2b env e1
>                                  e2'  <- eval2b env e2
>                                  case (e1', e2') of
>                                    (IntVal i1, IntVal i2) ->
>                                        return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
>                                    _ -> throwError "type error"
> eval2b env (Abs n e)     =   return $ FunVal env n e
> eval2b env (App e1 e2)   =   do  val1  <- eval2b env e1
>                                  val2  <- eval2b env e2
>                                  case val1 of
>                                     FunVal env' n body ->
>                                        eval2b (Map.insert n val2 env') body
>                                     _ -> throwError "type error"

Now, when we try to evaluate an invalid expression, we get an error
message, packaged in the |Left| constructor.  So by matching against
the result of an evaluation, we can distinguish between normal and
error results.

\begin{spec}
runEval2 (eval2a Map.empty (Plus (Lit 1) (Abs "x" (Var "x")))) =>
  Left "type error"
\end{spec}

But wait a minute!  What is about |Map.lookup n env|?  Shouldn't we
check whether it returns |Nothing| and generate an appropriate error
message?  As mentioned above, |Map.lookup| returns its result in an
arbitrary monad, and the |Control.Monad.Error| module gives the
necessary definitions so that it works just out of the box:

\begin{spec}
runEval2 (eval2b Map.empty (Var "x")) =>
  Left "Data.Map.lookup: Key not found"
\end{spec}

A little bit of closer inspection of function |eval2b| reveals that we
can do even shorter (better?) by exploiting the fact that monadic
binding in a |do| expression uses the |fail| function whenever a
pattern match fails.  And, as we have seen, the |fail| function does
what we want.

> eval2c                   ::  Env -> Exp -> Eval2 Value
> eval2c env (Lit i)       =   return $ IntVal i
> eval2c env (Var n)       =   Map.lookup n env
> eval2c env (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  IntVal i1  <- eval2c env e1
>                                  IntVal i2  <- eval2c env e2
>                                  return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
> eval2c env (Abs n e)     =   return $ FunVal env n e
> eval2c env (App e1 e2)   =   do  FunVal env' n body  <- eval2c env e1
>                                  val2                <- eval2c env e2
>                                  eval2c (Map.insert n val2 env') body

The drawback of this function is that the error messages only talks
about ``pattern match failure'', with no specific information about
why the pattern match fails.  Thus, in order to get good error
messages, it is better to provide our own calls to |throwError|.  This
is what we'll do for the final version of the error handling
evaluation.

> eval2                    ::  Env -> Exp -> Eval2 Value
> eval2  env (Lit i)       =   return $ IntVal i
> eval2  env (Var n)       =   case Map.lookup n env of
>                                Nothing -> throwError ("unbound variable: " ++ n)
>                                Just val -> return val
> eval2  env (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  e1'  <- eval2  env e1
>                                  e2'  <- eval2  env e2
>                                  case (e1', e2') of
>                                    (IntVal i1, IntVal i2) ->
>                                        return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
>                                    _ -> throwError "type error in addition"
> eval2  env (Abs n e)     =   return $ FunVal env n e
> eval2  env (App e1 e2)   =   do  val1  <- eval2  env e1
>                                  val2  <- eval2  env e2
>                                  case val1 of
>                                     FunVal env' n body ->
>                                        eval2  (Map.insert n val2 env') body
>                                     _ -> throwError "type error in application"

\paragraph{Note:} The |Control.Monad.Error| module provides another
function for catching errors raised using |throwError|, called
|catchError :: m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a| for arbitrary error monads.
It can be used for either handling errors locally or passing them on
to the surrounding calling context.

\subsection{Hiding the Environment}

One way to make the definition of the evaluation function even more
pleasing is to hide the environment from all function definitions and
calls.  Since there is only one place where the environment is
extended (for function application) and two places where it is
actually used (for variables and $\lambda$ expressions), we can reduce
the amount of code by hiding it in all other places.  This will be
done by adding a |ReaderT| monad transformer in order to implement a
reader monad.  A reader monad passes a value into a computation and
all its sub-computations.  This value can be read by all enclosed
computations and get modified for nested computations.  In contrast to
state monads (which will be introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:state-monad}), an encapsulated computation cannot
change the value used by surrounding computations.

We start by simply wrapping a |ReaderT| constructor around our
previous monad.

> type Eval3 alpha = ReaderT Env (ErrorT String Identity) alpha

The run function |runEval3| must be slightly modified, because we need
to pass in the initial environment.  The reason is that we will remove
the environment parameter from the evaluation function.

> runEval3     :: Env -> Eval3 alpha -> Either String alpha
> runEval3 env ev  = runIdentity (runErrorT (runReaderT ev env))

> eval3               ::  Exp -> Eval3 Value
> eval3 (Lit i)       =   return $ IntVal i
> eval3 (Var n)       =   do  env <- ask
>                             case Map.lookup n env of
>                                Nothing -> throwError ("unbound variable: " ++ n)
>                                Just val -> return val

>                                _ -> throwError "type error in application"

For our running example, we now have to evaluate
\begin{verbatim}
    runEval3 Map.empty (eval3 exampleExp)
\end{verbatim}

In all places where the current environment is needed, it is extracted
from the hidden state of the reader monad using the |ask| function.
In the case of function application, the |local| function is used for
modifying the environment for the recursive call.  Local has the type
|(r -> r) -> m a -> m a|, that is we need to pass in a function which
maps the current environment to the one to be used in the nested
computation, which is the second argument.  In our case, the nested
environment does not depend on the current environment, so we simply
pass in a constant function using |const|.

\paragraph{Note:} In addition to |ask|, a function |asks| is
predefined, which expects a function mapping the environment to a
value.  This can be used to extract individual components of the
environment by applying |asks| to record selector functions.

\subsection{Adding State}
\label{sec:state-monad}

Another important application of monads is to provide mutable state to
otherwise purely functional code.  This can be done using a |State|
monad, which provides operations for specifying an initial state,
querying the current state and changing it.

As an example, suppose that we want to add profiling capabilities to
our little interpreter.  We define the new monad by wrapping a
|StateT| constructor around the innermost monad, |Identity|.  (In the
case of |State| and |Error| monads, the order of these constructor
matters, as we will see below.)  The state maintained in our example
is a simple integer value, but it could be a value of any data type we
wish.  Normally, it will be a record holding the complete state
necessary for the task at hand.

> type Eval4 alpha = ReaderT Env (ErrorT String (StateT Integer Identity)) alpha

The return type of the function |runEval4| changes, because the final
state is returned together with the evaluation result (error or
value).  Additionally, we give the initial state as an additional
parameter so that we gain some flexibility (this can be used, for
example, to start a computation in the final state of another one).

> runEval4            ::  Env -> Integer -> Eval4 alpha -> (Either String alpha, Integer)
> runEval4 env st ev  =   runIdentity (runStateT (runErrorT (runReaderT ev env)) st)

For our simple example, we only want to count the number of evaluation
steps, that is the number of calls to the |eval4| function.  All
modification happens in a little helper function |tick|, which gets
the hidden state from the computation, increases the counter and
stores it back.  The type of |tick| is not |Eval4 ()|, as should be
expected, because we plan to re-use it in other sections below.
Therefore, we simply state that the monad in which |tick| will be used
must be a state monad, and that the state manipulated in that monad is
numeric, so that we can use the |(+)| operator on it.

> tick :: (Num s, MonadState s m) => m ()
> tick = do  st <- get
>            put (st + 1)

By adding a call to the |tick| function in each case, we can count the
number of applications.

> eval4               ::  Exp -> Eval4 Value
> eval4 (Lit i)       =   do  tick
>                             return $ IntVal i
> eval4 (Var n)       =   do  tick
>                             env <- ask
>                             case Map.lookup n env of
>                                Nothing -> throwError ("unbound variable: " ++ n)
>                                Just val -> return val
> eval4 (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  tick
>                             e1'  <- eval4 e1
>                             e2'  <- eval4 e2
>                             case (e1', e2') of
>                               (IntVal i1, IntVal i2) ->
>                                   return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
>                               _ -> throwError "type error in addition"
> eval4 (Abs n e)     =   do  tick
>                             env <- ask
>                             return $ FunVal env n e
> eval4 (App e1 e2)   =   do  tick
>                             val1  <- eval4 e1
>                             val2  <- eval4 e2
>                             case val1 of
>                                FunVal env' n body ->
>                                   local (const (Map.insert n val2 env'))
>                                     (eval4 body)
>                                _ -> throwError "type error in application"

Evaluating our example expression yields:
\begin{verbatim}
    (Right (IntVal 18),8)
\end{verbatim}
meaning that the evaluation was successful, returned the integer 18
and took 8 reduction steps.

\paragraph{Note:}

When the type of the |Eval4| monad is changed to the following
(|StateT| and |ErrorT| are swapped), the interpretation of the monad changes.

> type Eval4' alpha    =   ReaderT Env (StateT Integer (ErrorT String Identity)) alpha

Instead of returning a result (error or normal) and a state, either an
error or a result together with the final state is returned, as can be
seen in the type of the corresponding run function:

> runEval4'            ::  Env -> Integer -> Eval4' alpha -> (Either String (alpha, Integer))
> runEval4' env st ev  =   runIdentity (runErrorT (runStateT (runReaderT ev env) st))

The position of the reader monad transformer does not matter, since it
does not contribute to the final result.

\paragraph{Note:}

The |State| monad also provides an additional function, |gets| which
applies a projection function to the state before returning it.  There
is also a function |modify| which can be used to change the internal
state by applying a function over it.

\subsection{Adding Logging}

The last monad transformer in the toolbox which will be described here
is |WriterT|.  It is in some sense dual to |ReaderT|, because the
functions it provides let you add values to the result of the
computation instead of using some values passed in.

> type Eval5 alpha = ReaderT Env  (ErrorT String 
>                                 (WriterT [String] (StateT Integer Identity))) alpha

Similar to |StateT|, |WriterT| interacts with |ErrorT| because it
produces output.  So depending on the order of |ErrorT| and |WriterT|,
the result will include the values written out or not when an error
occurs.  The values to be written out will be lists of strings.  When
you read the documentation for the |WriterT| monad transformer, you
will notice that the type of the output values is restricted to be a
member of the type class |Monoid|.  This is necessary because the
methods of this class are used internally to construct the initial
value and to combine several values written out.

The running function is extended in the same way as earlier.

> runEval5            ::  Env -> Integer -> Eval5 alpha -> ((Either String alpha, [String]), Integer)
> runEval5 env st ev  =   
>     runIdentity (runStateT (runWriterT (runErrorT (runReaderT ev env))) st)

In the evaluation function, we illustrate the use of the writer monad
by writing out the name of each variable encountered during evaluation.

> eval5               ::  Exp -> Eval5 Value
> eval5 (Lit i)       =   do  tick
>                             return $ IntVal i
> eval5 (Var n)       =   do  tick
>                             tell [n]
>                             env <- ask
>                             case Map.lookup n env of
>                                Nothing -> throwError ("unbound variable: " ++ n)
>                                Just val -> return val
> eval5 (Plus e1 e2)  =   do  tick
>                             e1'  <- eval5 e1
>                             e2'  <- eval5 e2
>                             case (e1', e2') of
>                               (IntVal i1, IntVal i2) ->
>                                   return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)
>                               _ -> throwError "type error in addition"
> eval5 (Abs n e)     =   do  tick
>                             env <- ask
>                             return $ FunVal env n e
> eval5 (App e1 e2)   =   do  tick
>                             val1  <- eval5 e1
>                             val2  <- eval5 e2
>                             case val1 of
>                                FunVal env' n body ->
>                                   local (const (Map.insert n val2 env'))
>                                     (eval5 body)
>                                _ -> throwError "type error in application"

\subsection{What about I/O?}

Until now, we have not considered one importand aspect: input and
output.  How do we integrate I/O into the monadic definitions we have
developed so far?  It is not possible to define an I/O monad
transformer, because the execution of I/O operations in Haskell cannot
be arbitrarily nested into other functions or monads, they are only
allowed in the monad |IO|.  Fortunately, the monad transformer library
provides us with the infrastructure to easily integrate I/O operations
into our framework: we simply substitute |IO| where we have used
|Identity|!  This is possible because |Identity| is the base monad,
and as we have seen, the function |runIdentity| for evaluating actions
in this monad is always applied last.

> type Eval6 alpha = ReaderT Env  (ErrorT String 
>                                 (WriterT [String] (StateT Integer IO))) alpha

The return type of |runEval6| is wrapped in an |IO| constructor, which
means that the running an |Eval6| computation does not directly yield
a result, but an I/O computation which must be run in order to get at
the result.  Accordingly, the |runIdentity| invocation disappears.

> runEval6           ::  Env -> Integer -> Eval6 alpha -> IO ((Either String alpha, [String]), Integer)
> runEval6 env st ev  =   
>     runStateT (runWriterT (runErrorT (runReaderT ev env))) st

In the |eval6| function we can now use I/O operations, with one minor
notational inconvenience: we have to invoke the operations using the
function |liftIO|, which lifts the I/O computation into the currently
running monad.  As an example, we chose to print out each integer
constant as soon as it is evaluated.  (We don't think this is good
style, but it illustrates the point and sometimes makes a good
debugging technique.)

> eval6               ::  Exp -> Eval6 Value
> eval6 (Lit i)       =   do  tick
>                             liftIO $ print i
>                             return $ IntVal i
> eval6 (Var n)       =   do  tick
>                             tell [n]
>                             env <- ask
>                             case Map.lookup n env of

>                             e2'  <- eval6 e2
>                             case (e1', e2') of
>                               (IntVal i1, IntVal i2) ->
>                                   return $ IntVal (i1 + i2)

\section{Conclusion}

Monad transformers are a powerful tool in the toolbox of a functional
programmer.  This paper introduces several of the monad transformers
available in current Haskell implementations, and shows how to use and
combine them in the context of a simple functional interpreter.

We have not covered all monad transformers presently implemented in
Haskell (e.g., continuation and list monad transformers) and recommend
to read the library documentation available from the Haskell web site for
additional information.

The use of monad transformers makes it very easy to define specialized
monads for many applications, reducing the temptation to put
everything possibly needed into the one and only monad hand-made for
the current application.

Happy hacking in Haskell!
